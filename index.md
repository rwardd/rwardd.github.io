## About Me
I am a 23 year old software/electronics/computer engineer. I have a formal education in electrical 
and computer engineering, however, most of my professional experience has consisted of writing firmware,
software and gateware for a variety of applications. 

I love computers and their history - humanity's
progression from vacuum tubes to RTX 4090's will always be something that fascinates me. Discovering 
historical and influential figures in the computing world is something I enjoy, and I really admire the likes of 
Ritchie, Thompson, Knuth, Lattner, Stallman, Torvalds and Hotz to name a few.

## Experience
* **Praetorian Aeronautics (2025 - current)**
    - Yet to start

* **Boeing Defence Australia (2023 - 2025)**
    - Implemented firmware on STM32 targets on a FreeRTOS platform
    - Wrote and integrated custom IC drivers
    - Debugging firmware (GDB is awesome)
    - PCBA/CCA verification
    - Custom IP core development in VHDL
    - HDL development targeting the Zynq7000 SoC using Vivado/Vitis
    - Unit testbench development
    - Debugging RF hardware and gateware
    - C standard library testing
<p></p>
* **University of Queensland (2022 - 2023)**
    - Developed a decentralised application for event ticketing
<p></p>
* **Various Startups (2021 - 2022)**
    - Casual software development

## Education
I hold a Bachelor's (Honours) and Master's degree of Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Queensland.

## Projects
**Zip RTOS**
: In an effort to keep up with the times, I wanted to learn the [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) programming language in a freestanding context.
What better way than to try and write a simple baremetal RTOS? The project is hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/rwardd/zip), and still needs a lot of work.
: So far, I have written a super basic task scheduler that will round-robin schedule an arbitrary number of tasks. 

Check out my [blog](blog/blog.html), there will be more published soon!
